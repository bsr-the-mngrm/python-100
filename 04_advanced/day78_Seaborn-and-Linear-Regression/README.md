## Linear Regression and Data Visiualization with Seaborn

# Objective

- How to use a popular data visualisation library called Seaborn
- How to run and interpret a linear regression with scikit-learn
- How to plot a regression a scatter plot to visualize relationships in the data
- How to add a third dimension to a scatter plot to create a bubble chart
- How to cleverly use floor division ```//``` to convert your data

# Learning Points & Summary

- Use nested loops to remove unwanted characters from multiple columns
- Filter Pandas DataFrames based on multiple conditions using both ```.loc[]``` and ```.query()```
- Create bubble charts using the Seaborn Library
- Style Seaborn charts using the pre-built styles and by modifying Matplotlib parameters
- Use floor division (i.e., integer division) to convert years to decades
- Use Seaborn to superimpose a linear regression over our data
- Make a judgement if our regression is good or bad based on how well the model fits our data and the r-squared metric
- Run regressions with scikit-learn and calculate the coefficents
