## Computation with NumPy and N-Dimensional Arrays

# Objective

- How to leverage the power ðŸ’ª of NumPy's ndarrays
- How to access individual values and subsets inside an n-dimensional array
- How broadcasting ðŸ“£ works with ndarrays
- How to do linear algebra with NumPy
- How to generate points that you can plot on a chart
- How to manipulate images as ndarrays

# Learning points & Summary

- Create arrays manually with ```np.array()```
- Generate arrays using ```.arange()```, ```.random()```, and ```.linspace()```
- Analyse the shape and dimensions of a ndarray
- Slice and subset a ndarray based on its indexes
- Do linear algebra like operations with scalars and matrix multiplication
- Use NumPys broadcasting to make ndarray shapes compatible
- Manipulate images in the form of ndarrays
