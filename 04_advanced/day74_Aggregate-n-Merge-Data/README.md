## Aggregate and Merge Data with Pandas

# Objective

- Apply Python List slicing techniques to Pandas DataFrame
- Aggregate data using the ```.agg()``` function
- Create scatter plots, bar charts, and line charts with two axes in Matplotlib
- Understand database schemas that are organized by primary and foreign keys
- Merge DataFrames that share a common key

## Learning points

- combine the ```groupby()``` and ```count()``` functions to aggregate data
- use the ```.value_counts()``` function
- slice DataFrames using the square bracket notation e.g., ```df[:-2]``` or ```df[:10]```
- use the ```.agg()``` function to run an operation on a particular column
- ```rename()``` columns of DataFrames
- create a line chart with two separate axes to visualize data that have different scales
- create a scatter plot in Matplotlib
- work with tables in a relational database by using primary and foreign keys
- ```.merge()``` DataFrames along a particular column
- create a bar chart with Matplotlib
